# County Status Tracker

## General Updates

- `2021-01-21` Nearly done with pivot + validation for the Open Elections precinct level election results. Validation was performed against official county level results tolerating a 5% difference at worst. 

## Genesee County 

- `2021-01-21` Election results from Open Elections are missing party data so I can't pivot on party. Wasn't able to find anything on their website on my first pass so I need to follow up with them to see if they can provide a copy of their results with party data.


## Lewis County

- `2021-01-21` Difference between Lewis County results in Open Elections data, but it can be explained by the exclusion of the `Abs/Aff` column in Open Elections' data set. Using [this](https://www.lewiscounty.org/media/Board%20of%20Elections/Election%20Results/2018/GE18%20Election%20Results) as my source of truth. Need to contact Lewis County board of elections to proceed.
